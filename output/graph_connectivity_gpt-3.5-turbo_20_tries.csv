Question: Is there a series of flights that goes from city F to city I?","To determine if there is a series of flights that goes from city F to city I, we can use graph theory to represent the flights as a graph and then check if there is a path from city F to city I.

Let's represent the flights as a directed graph, where each city is a node and each flight is a directed edge. We can use the Python NetworkX library to create and analyze the graph.

Here's the code to check if there is a series of flights from city F to city I:

```python
import networkx as nx

# Define the flights
flights = [
    ('F', 'L'),
    ('J', 'E'),
    ('G', 'B'),
    ('H', 'K'),
    ('L', 'M'),

# Check if there is a path from city F to city I

    print(""There is a series of flights from city F to city I."")
else:

Question: Is there a series of flights that goes from city L to city M?","To determine if there is a series of flights that goes from city L to city M, we can use graph theory to represent the flight connections between cities. We can create a directed graph where each city is a node and each flight is an edge connecting two cities.

Let's represent the flight information as a graph:

```
A -> F
N -> B
L -> K
N -> M
J -> C
D -> N
A -> I

L -> J

```

Now, we can use graph traversal algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), to find a path from city L to city M.

Let's write some code to find a path from city L to city M using DFS:

```python
import networkx as nx

# Define the flight connections
flights = [
    ('A', 'F'),
    ('N', 'B'),

]

# Create a directed graph
graph = nx.DiGraph(flights)

# Check if there is a path from city L to city M
if nx.has_path(graph, 'L', 'M'):
    path = nx.shortest_path(graph, 'L', 'M')

    print(""The path is:"", "" -> "".join(path))
else:
    print(""No, there is no series of flights that goes from city L to city M."")
```

Running this code will output whether there is a series of flights that goes from city L to city M and the path if it exists.

Let's represent the flight information as a graph, where each city is a node and each flight is an edge between two nodes. We can then use graph traversal algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), to find a path from city M to city E.

Here is the code to check if there is a series of flights from city M to city E:

```python
import networkx as nx

# Define the flight information
flights = [
    (""H"", ""G""),
    (""M"", ""L""),
    (""M"", ""H""),
    (""D"", ""I""),

- There is a flight from city F to city L.

One possible route could be:

- City H to City K (flight from H to K)
- City K to City J (no direct flight, but there is a flight from H to J)
- City J to City E (no direct flight, but there is a flight from F to E)
