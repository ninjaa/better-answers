Running Graph Connectivity...
Current flight information (the following flights are one-way only, and all the flights available are included below):
There is a flight from city F to city L
There is a flight from city J to city E
There is a flight from city G to city B
There is a flight from city H to city K
There is a flight from city L to city M
There is a flight from city F to city H
There is a flight from city G to city J
There is a flight from city B to city I
There is a flight from city L to city A
There is a flight from city H to city N
There is a flight from city B to city D
There is a flight from city J to city C

Question: Is there a series of flights that goes from city F to city I?

Current flight information (the following flights are one-way only, and all the flights available are included below):
There is a flight from city M to city L
There is a flight from city I to city A

There is a flight from city H to city E
There is a flight from city H to city C
There is a flight from city K to city N

There is a flight from city G to city H
There is a flight from city I to city D

Question: Is there a series of flights that goes from city K to city C?

Current flight information (the following flights are one-way only, and all the flights available are included below):
There is a flight from city K to city N
There is a flight from city N to city G
There is a flight from city L to city I
There is a flight from city H to city L
There is a flight from city L to city D
There is a flight from city H to city A
There is a flight from city N to city J
There is a flight from city K to city E
There is a flight from city A to city M
There is a flight from city E to city C
There is a flight from city A to city B
There is a flight from city E to city F

Question: Is there a series of flights that goes from city K to city D?
INFO: Using a LocalBox which is not isolated.
