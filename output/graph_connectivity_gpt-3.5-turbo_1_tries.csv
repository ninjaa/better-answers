14.4,"Current flight information (the following flights are one-way only, and all the flights available are included below):
There is a flight from city F to city L
There is a flight from city J to city E
There is a flight from city G to city B
There is a flight from city H to city K
There is a flight from city L to city M
There is a flight from city F to city H
There is a flight from city G to city J
There is a flight from city B to city I
There is a flight from city L to city A
There is a flight from city H to city N
There is a flight from city B to city D
There is a flight from city J to city C

Question: Is there a series of flights that goes from city F to city I?","To determine if there is a series of flights that goes from city F to city I, we can use graph theory to represent the flights as a graph and then check if there is a path from city F to city I.

Let's represent the flights as a directed graph, where each city is a node and each flight is a directed edge. We can use the Python NetworkX library to create and analyze the graph.

Here's the code to check if there is a series of flights from city F to city I:

```python
import networkx as nx

# Define the flights
flights = [
    ('F', 'L'),
    ('J', 'E'),
    ('G', 'B'),
    ('H', 'K'),
    ('L', 'M'),
    ('F', 'H'),
    ('G', 'J'),
    ('B', 'I'),
    ('L', 'A'),
    ('H', 'N'),
    ('B', 'D'),
    ('J', 'C')
]

# Create a directed graph
graph = nx.DiGraph(flights)

# Check if there is a path from city F to city I
if nx.has_path(graph, 'F', 'I'):
    print(""Yes, there is a series of flights from city F to city I."")
else:
    print(""No, there is no series of flights from city F to city I."")
```

Running this code will output the result: ""No, there is no series of flights from city F to city I.""

Please note that the code assumes that the flights are one-way only and that all the flights available are included in the given list. If there are additional flights or if the flights are bidirectional, the code may need to be modified accordingly.",No
